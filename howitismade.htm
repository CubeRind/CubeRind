<h2>How It Is Made</h2>
									<p>The first thing you need to know is how the cube is made. There are three types of pieces on the 3x3 Rubikâ€™s cube. There are the centrepieces, which are obviously in the centre and these pieces never move. </p>
									<img src="img1.jpg" alt="The piece in the centre of the side is the centre piece.">
										<p>So no matter how many turns I do, this side will be the white side because it has the white centrepiece.</p>
										<p>So these pieces never move. Next, we have the edge pieces. The edges are the pieces on the edge of the cube.</p>

											<p>You can see that there are these two colours that are combined and they're placed on the edge of the cube.</p>
											<p>So all edge pieces have two colours. This edge piece is the orange and yellow one, but you can see there are many different types of edge pieces and in total there are 12 edge pieces on a Rubik's cube. Next, we have corner pieces. This is the third type of piece and on the corner piece, we have three different colours.</p>
											<img src="img3.png" width="465" height="332" alt="This corner piece is the yellow, green and orange corner piece.">
												<p>This corner piece is the yellow, green and orange corner piece.</p>
												<p>There are a total of eight corner pieces on a Rubik's cube.</p>
