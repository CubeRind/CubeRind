<h2>5th Step</h2>
																																			<p>Next, we need to solve the corners. What you're gonna do is you're gonna change how you are holding the cube and put the yellow side on the bottom. Next, we're going to see a yellow corner that isn't properly solved, so we don't care if it's matching with the centres yet or not as long as it's properly facing the top it's fine. Just pick one of them and like we did before, hold it on the right and do the same algorithm we did at   the beginning for the first layer.
																																				<b> R U R’ U’,</b> you might think you messed everything up, but don't worry, just keep on doing it until it's solved properly. Now this part is very important, once you solve one of the yellow corner pieces, do not change how you are holding the cube. Just do D-turns to put the next unsolved yellow edge on the right side.
