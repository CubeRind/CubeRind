                    <h2>Cube Notation</h2>
														<p>The next thing you need to know is notation. So now we're going to learn notation. Notation is the letters we're going to use when we're doing algorithms. Algorithms might sound super complicated but it's not that hard. Let me just explain notation. This is the basic notation you need to know, there is some more advanced notation, but you do not need to know that for this tutorial. If you already know about notation you can go to step 1, but if you don't, let's cover this. So there are six sides on the cube as we know so there are six different letters you need to know. There's U for up. there's D for down. there's R for right, there's L for left, there's F for front and there's B for back. So now, when we do cube notation and we say just the letter, that means we turn that face clockwise. So if we say U, we want to turn the U layer or the up layer clockwise, that would be this way. If we say Uâ€™, that means we turn that side counterclockwise, this is the same for all sides. Next, if I say U2, that means we turn that side two times, now since we're turning it two times, it doesn't matter which direction we do it. It will make no difference, so you could do it whatever way you want. So now try this set of moves and see if you can do it.</p>
